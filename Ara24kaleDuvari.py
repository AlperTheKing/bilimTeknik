    # CLUE CONSTRAINTS:
    # Clues of the form: a number and direction specifying how long contiguous loop segments
    # are inside the loop in that direction.
    # Implementing this is complex. Here's a conceptual approach:
    # For each clue cell (r,c):
    #   1. Determine which direction we look (U/D/L/R).
    #   2. Inside must be True (generally) or follow puzzle rules.
    #   3. Traverse cells in that direction until hitting the loop boundary.
    #   4. Count the length of continuous inside-segment edges.
    #
    # One way: Create auxiliary variables representing the count of visible edges in that direction
    # and enforce it equals the clue number.
    #
    # Pseudocode placeholder:
    #
    # for clue in clues:
    #     rr = clue['row']
    #     cc = clue['col']
    #     direction = clue['direction']
    #     number = clue['number']
    #
    #     # Ensure inside if required by puzzle (some versions require clue cells to be inside)
    #     # model.Add(inside[rr][cc] == 1)
    #
    #     # Traverse in given direction inside the loop:
    #     #   define variables to count continuous edges. This is scenario-specific.
    #     #
    #     # For example, if direction = 'R', look to the right:
    #     #   Check horizontal edges, inside states, etc.
    #     #
    #     # Due to complexity, this step is highly puzzle-specific.
